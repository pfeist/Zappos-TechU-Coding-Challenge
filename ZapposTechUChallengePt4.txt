	The thing that excites me about Zappos is their world-famous culture and dedication to the ultimate customer experience.  When I watch employee videos and read their blogs I can see the pride they have in their company and the work that they do.  I want the chance to be a part of this extraordinary organization and see what it feels like to be a part of the Zappos Family.
	This apprenticeship excites me because it is a dream opportunity for me.  I have often heard "find someone to pay youto do what you love, and you will never work again," and the TechU apprenticeship represents the first step on my way to this goal.  Since beginning my IT degree with University of Phoenix it has become more clear to me that my true passion lies in programming and development, and I have used any spare moment between my full-time job, new baby, and full-time school schedule to teach myself how to create simple programs.  I am ready (and eager!) to take this enthusiasm on to the next level and begin learning how to develop useful applications, programs, and websites.  The coding challenge alone has taught me new skills in the areas of responsive web design and using recursion in Java programs, both being concepts I was unfamiliar with before beginning the challenge. 
	I just want to reiterate how excited I am to be considered for this opportunity.  I look forward to the challenges ahead and hope to hear from you soon.
